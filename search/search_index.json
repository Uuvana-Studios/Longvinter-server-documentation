For port forwarding instructions, please refer to the information/documentation provided by your ISP or router/modem manufacturer. For opening ports in your linux machine use the following depending on the firewall software you are using: Warning In other tutorials it is asked to open the TCP Port 7777, do not do it. Unreal Engine doesn't use TCP connections - you would be leaving a unused port open by doing so! IPTables sudo iptables -I INPUT -p udp --dport 7777 -j ACCEPT sudo iptables -I INPUT -p udp --dport 27016 -j ACCEPT sudo iptables -I INPUT -p tcp --dport 27016 -j ACCEPT sudo iptables -I INPUT -p udp --dport 27015 -j ACCEPT sudo iptables -I INPUT -p tcp --dport 27015 -j ACCEPT Uncomplicated Firewall (UFW) sudo ufw allow 7777 /udp sudo ufw allow 27016 sudo ufw allow 27015 Setting up the container Downloading the container Downloading the container can be done by either using git (recommended), or by clicking the green Code button on this page and using the Download ZIP option on the Docker Image Github . To download the container configuration using git, use the command below git clone https://github.com/tvandoorn/longvinter-docker-server.git Creating the data directory In order to keep game progress between container restarts a data directory needs to be created. Create this directory in the same directory as the docker-compose.yaml file. Use the following commands to create the directory and set the appropriate rights. mkdir data chown -R 1200 :1200 data/ Configuring the server settings The server settings can be changed by opening the docker-compose.yaml file. Settings that may be changed are shown below: Setting name Used for Default value CFG_SERVER_NAME Setting the server name that is displayed in the server list. Unnamed Island CFG_MAX_PLAYERS The maximum amount of players the server will allow at the same time. 32 CFG_SERVER_MOTD A Message Of The Day that will be displayed to the player. Welcome to Longvinter Island! CFG_PASSWORD Use this setting to require a password to join the server. (empty) CFG_COMMUNITY_WEBSITE When the server or community has a website, enter it here to display it to the player. www.longvinter.com CFG_ADMIN_STEAM_ID Add the SteamID64 values for the players that have admin rights to this setting. When there are multiple admins, add the SteamID64 values to this setting separated by a space. (empty) CFG_ENABLE_PVP When this setting is set to \"true\", PvP will be enabled on the server. Set to \"false\" to disable PvP. true CFG_GAME_PORT This setting is used to change the game port when multiple servers are running on the same (public) IP address. When changing this setting, make sure to also change the port number under the ports section of the docker-compose.yaml file. 7777 CFG_QUERY_PORT This setting is used to change the query port when multiple servers are running on the same (public) IP address. When changing this setting, make sure to also change the port number under the ports section of the docker-compose.yaml file. 27016 With the default values above, the environment part of the docker-compose.yaml file should look like this: environment : CFG_SERVER_NAME : \"Unnamed Island\" CFG_MAX_PLAYERS : \"32\" CFG_SERVER_MOTD : \"Welcome to Longvinter Island!\" CFG_PASSWORD : \"\" CFG_COMMUNITY_WEBSITE : \"www.longvinter.com\" CFG_ADMIN_STEAM_ID : \"\" CFG_ENABLE_PVP : \"true\" CFG_GAME_PORT : \"7777\" CFG_QUERY_PORT : \"27016\" Changing the port numbers In order to run the server with different port numbers than the default ports 7777 and 27016 , the new port numbers have to be edited in two places in the docker-compose.yaml file. ports : - \"7777:7777\" - \"27016:27016\" environment : CFG_GAME_PORT : \"7777\" CFG_QUERY_PORT : \"27016\" Note Even though changing the ports is possible, it is currently not supported by the game! Starting the container When the setup and configuration is done, the container is ready to be started. Open the command line and navigate to the directory (using the cd command) that contains the Dockerfile , docker-compose.yaml and run.sh files. Start the container using the following command: docker-compose up -d This command will do the following: Build the container image (if not present) Create the container Start the container Run the included startup script ( run.sh ) inside the container Clone or update the longvinter-linux-server repository Create or update the Game.ini file with the settings provided in the docker-compose.yaml file Start the Longvinter server Stopping the container To stop the container, run the command below. Note that this removes the container from Docker, but the save data will be saved in the data directory and will be loaded when the server is started again next time. docker-compose down Updating the container When a new version of the container is released, make sure to update the files using git pull , or manually update the files by downloading the code as ZIP from Github. Run the command below to build the new container image and restart the container. docker-compose up -d --build Note that these commands have to be run from the same directory as the Dockerfile , docker-compose.yaml and run.sh files. Updating the Longvinter server Updating the Longvinter server is as easy as restarting the container: docker-compose restart Running multiple Longvinter containers on one Docker server Running multiple Longvinter containers on one Docker server is very easy. Follow the Setting up the container steps again, but this time set up the server to use a different directory for the new server. git clone https://github.com/tvandoorn/longvinter-docker-server.git new-name-here The command above will download the container files in a directory named new-name-here . Make sure to change the server ports using the Changing the port numbers step.

Then open the Docker Dashboard by right-clicking the docker icon on the bottom right of your screen, or open Docker using your start menu. Depending on your OS and/or updates you may be asked to install \"WSL 2\". Make sure you do this as well. Setting up the container Choosing a location on your computer/server It is recommended to place the server in your documents or on your desktop for ease of access. Open Windows Explorer where you would like to place the server and right click somewhere. Click the option \"Git Bash Here\". This will open a command line in the location you right-clicked. From here, execute the commands in the next chapters. Downloading the container Downloading the container can be done by either using git (recommended), or by clicking the green code button on this page and using the Download ZIP option on the Docker Image Github . To download the container configuration using git, use the command below: git clone https://github.com/Uuvana-Studios/longvinter-docker-server.git When the clone is finished, enter the directory the git command created: cd longvinter-docker-server Creating the data directory In order to keep game progress between container restarts a data directory needs to be created. Create this directory in the same directory as the docker-compose.yaml file. Use the following commands to create the directory and set the appropriate rights. mkdir data Configuring the server settings The server settings can be changed by opening the docker-compose.yaml file. Use either Notepad or a more advanced text editor such as Notepad++. Do not open the configuration using WordPad or Word! Settings that may be changed are shown below: Setting name Used for Default value CFG_SERVER_NAME Setting the server name that is displayed in the server list. Unnamed Island CFG_MAX_PLAYERS The maximum amount of players the server will allow at the same time. 32 CFG_SERVER_MOTD A Message Of The Day that will be displayed to the player.

When there are multiple admins, add the SteamID64 values to this setting separated by a space. (empty) CFG_ENABLE_PVP When this setting is set to \"true\", PvP will be enabled on the server. Set to \"false\" to disable PvP. true CFG_GAME_PORT This setting is used to change the game port when multiple servers are running on the same (public) IP address. When changing this setting, make sure to also change the port number under the ports section of the docker-compose.yaml file. 7777 CFG_QUERY_PORT This setting is used to change the query port when multiple servers are running on the same (public) IP address. When changing this setting, make sure to also change the port number under the ports section of the docker-compose.yaml file. 27016 With the default values above, the environment part of the docker-compose.yaml file should look like this: environment : CFG_SERVER_NAME : \"Unnamed Island\" CFG_MAX_PLAYERS : \"32\" CFG_SERVER_MOTD : \"Welcome to Longvinter Island!\" CFG_PASSWORD : \"\" CFG_COMMUNITY_WEBSITE : \"www.longvinter.com\" CFG_ADMIN_STEAM_ID : \"\" CFG_ENABLE_PVP : \"true\" CFG_GAME_PORT : \"7777\" CFG_QUERY_PORT : \"27016\" Changing the port numbers In order to run the server with different port numbers than the default ports 7777 and 27016 , the new port numbers have to be edited in two places in the docker-compose.yaml file. ports : - \"7777:7777\" - \"27016:27016\" environment : CFG_GAME_PORT : \"7777\" CFG_QUERY_PORT : \"27016\" Note Even though changing the ports is possible, it is currently not supported by the game! Starting the container When the setup and configuration is done, the container is ready to be started. Open the command line and navigate to the directory (using the cd command) that contains the Dockerfile , docker-compose.yaml and run.sh files. Start the container using the following command: docker-compose up -d This command will do the following: Build the container image (if not present) Create the container Start the container Run the included startup script ( run.sh ) inside the container Clone or update the longvinter-linux-server repository Create or update the Game.ini file with the settings provided in the docker-compose.yaml file Start the Longvinter server Stopping the container To stop the container, run the command below. Note that this removes the container from Docker, but the save data will be saved in the data directory and will be loaded when the server is started again next time. docker-compose down Updating the container When a new version of the container is released, make sure to update the files using git pull , or manually update the files by downloading the code as ZIP from Github. Run the command below to build the new container image and restart the container. docker-compose up -d --build Note Remember that these commands have to be run from the same directory as the Dockerfile , docker-compose.yaml and run.sh files. Updating the Longvinter server Updating the Longvinter server is as easy as restarting the container: docker-compose restart Running multiple Longvinter containers on one Docker server Running multiple Longvinter containers on one Docker server is very easy. Follow the Setting up the container steps again, but this time set up the server to use a different directory for the new server. git clone https://github.com/Uuvana-Studios/longvinter-docker-server.git new-name-here The command above will download the container files in a directory named new-name-here . Make sure to change the server ports using the Changing the port numbers step. Note This works in theory but, remember, that even though changing the ports is possible, it is currently not supported by the game! Open Ports You also need to open ports on your home router to allow traffic go through. This process is greatly different from what type of router you have. It is recommended to look in the manual provided by the manufacturer or contact your ISP for instructions. Warning In other tutorials it is asked to open the TCP Port 7777, do not do it. Unreal Engine doesn't use TCP connections - you would be leaving a unused port open by doing so! For Steam open: 27015 & 27016 (TCP and UDP) For Unreal Engine open: 7777 (UDP Only) In some cases, opening the ports in your home router is not enough. In that case you usually also need to allow the ports in your software firewall. Windows has a built-in firewall, but some antivirus packages also include a firewall feature. For changing the settings on your antivirus firewall, look for instructions online or contact the developer directly. Setting ports rules on Windows Firewall In order to open the ports in the included Windows Firewall, follow the steps below: Open the Start Menu and search for \"Windows Defender Firewall with Advanced Security\", or the equivalent in your language. Right-click the Inbound Rules option on the left side and choose New Rule... In the window that opens, select the Port option and click Next. Next, enter the port that you wish to forward, select the correct protocol (TCP or UDP) and click Next. Make sure \"Allow the connection\" is selected and click Next. Make sure all options are selected and click Next. Give the firewall rule a recognizable name (Such as Longvinter [port]) and click Finish. Make sure to repeat steps 2-7 for each port that needs to be openend in the firewall.","title":"Docker Setup"},{"location":"windows/setup-docker/#docker-setup","text":"If you have any trouble following the guide.

You can also use CMD if you installed just GIT and not the GIT BASH. Enter the following command to clone the GitHub repository to your wanted folder: NOTE: cloning creates a new folder for the files so no need to make a folder for the repository beforehand. git clone https://github.com/Uuvana-Studios/longvinter-windows-server.git Once the cloning is done you should see the following files inside the folder command created. You now have installed the server! Customizing the server You can customize some server parameters by editing the Game.ini config file Go to server folder and navigate to Longvinter ->Saved -> Config -> WindowsServer Here you should create a new file and name it Game.ini Open it for edit. You can use any text editor you want. Add the following content inside this file.

Running the server For easy starting and closing, I recommend creating a shortcut for LongvinterServer.exe Right-click the file and press create a shortcut. Then right-click the shortcut and open the Properties panel, here you need to edit the Target field in the shortcut tab. Add the -log to the right side of the path. This is telling the program that we want to open a command panel for the server program. This helps us verify that the server starts correctly After edit just Press \"OK\" to save the edit. Then you can start the server with the shortcut. If the console is not opened you need to close the server using Task Manager. To verify that server started correctly look for these 3 lines in the console window. If these lines are not present look further up the command line for any error or other warnings that are Steam related. You can also use the Steam server tool to see if your server is visible in the LAN space. If your server shows up on the LAN tab but not in the game's server browser.

Updating To Latest build I suggest you update the server every time you start it. The best rule of thumb is that if your game has updated in steam. This means you also have to update the server. Updating is done by opening the server folder in GIT BASH or in CMD as I showed earlier. The difference is that you now have to be inside the folder and not where it is located. First, verify that you are in the folder by typing: git status If console prints: fatal: not a git repository (or any of the parent directories): .git This means you are in the wrong folder and you cannot pull the update from here.
