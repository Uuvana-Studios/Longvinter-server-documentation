Please send us a message in Discord we are more than happy to help you out! Requirements and prerequisites Docker Docker Compose Git For help installing Docker, go to Install Docker using the Repository For help installing Docker Compose, go to Install Docker Compose Setting up the container Downloading the container Downloading the container can be done by either using git (recommended), or by clicking the green Code button on this page and using the Download ZIP option on the Docker Image Github . To download the container configuration using git, use the command below git clone https://github.com/tvandoorn/longvinter-docker-server.git Creating the data directory In order to keep game progress between container restarts a data directory needs to be created. Create this directory in the same directory as the docker-compose.yaml file. Use the following commands to create the directory and set the appropriate rights. mkdir data chown -R 1200:1200 data/ Configuring the server settings The server settings can be changed by opening the docker-compose.yaml file. Settings that may be changed are shown below: Setting name Used for Default value CFG_SERVER_NAME Setting the server name that is displayed in the server list. Unnamed Island CFG_MAX_PLAYERS The maximum amount of players the server will allow at the same time. 32 CFG_SERVER_MOTD A Message Of The Day that will be displayed to the player. Welcome to Longvinter Island! CFG_PASSWORD Use this setting to require a password to join the server. (empty) CFG_COMMUNITY_WEBSITE When the server or community has a website, enter it here to display it to the player. www.longvinter.com CFG_ADMIN_STEAM_ID Add the SteamID64 values for the players that have admin rights to this setting. When there are multiple admins, add the SteamID64 values to this setting separated by a space. (empty) CFG_ENABLE_PVP When this setting is set to \"true\", PvP will be enabled on the server. Set to \"false\" to disable PvP. true CFG_GAME_PORT This setting is used to change the game port when multiple servers are running on the same (public) IP address. When changing this setting, make sure to also change the port number under the ports section of the docker-compose.yaml file. 7777 CFG_QUERY_PORT This setting is used to change the query port when multiple servers are running on the same (public) IP address. When changing this setting, make sure to also change the port number under the ports section of the docker-compose.yaml file. 27016 With the default values above, the environment part of the docker-compose.yaml file should look like this: environment: CFG_SERVER_NAME: \"Unnamed Island\" CFG_MAX_PLAYERS: \"32\" CFG_SERVER_MOTD: \"Welcome to Longvinter Island!\" CFG_PASSWORD: \"\" CFG_COMMUNITY_WEBSITE: \"www.longvinter.com\" CFG_ADMIN_STEAM_ID: \"\" CFG_ENABLE_PVP: \"true\" CFG_GAME_PORT: \"7777\" CFG_QUERY_PORT: \"27016\" Changing the port numbers In order to run the server with different port numbers than the default ports 7777 and 27016 , the new port numbers have to be edited in two places in the docker-compose.yaml file. ports: - \"7777:7777\" - \"27016:27016\" environment: CFG_GAME_PORT: \"7777\" CFG_QUERY_PORT: \"27016\" NOTE: Even though changing the ports is possible, it is currently not supported by the game! Starting the container When the setup and configuration is done, the container is ready to be started. Open the command line and navigate to the directory (using the cd command) that contains the Dockerfile , docker-compose.yaml and run.sh files. Start the container using the following command: docker-compose up -d This command will do the following: 1. Build the container image (if not present) 2. Create the container 3. Start the container 4. Run the included startup script ( run.sh ) inside the container 1. Clone or update the longvinter-linux-server repository 2. Create or update the Game.ini file with the settings provided in the docker-compose.yaml file 5. Start the Longvinter server Stopping the container To stop the container, run the command below. Note that this removes the container from Docker, but the save data will be saved in the data directory and will be loaded when the server is started again next time. docker-compose down Updating the container When a new version of the container is released, make sure to update the files using git pull , or manually update the files by downloading the code as ZIP from Github. Run the command below to build the new container image and restart the container. docker-compose up -d --build Note that these commands have to be run from the same directory as the Dockerfile , docker-compose.yaml and run.sh files. Updating the Longvinter server Updating the Longvinter server is as easy as restarting the container: docker-compose restart Running multiple Longvinter containers on one Docker server Running multiple Longvinter containers on one Docker server is very easy. Follow the Setting up the container steps again, but this time set up the server to use a different directory for the new server. git clone https://github.com/tvandoorn/longvinter-docker-server.git new-name-here The command above will download the container files in a directory named new-name-here . Make sure to change the server ports using the Changing the port numbers step. NOTE: Even though changing the ports is possible, it is currently not supported by the game! Portforwarding and firewalls When running the container it might be necessary to do port forwarding or open ports in your firewall. For port forwarding instructions, please refer to the information/documentation provided by your ISP or router/modem manufacturer. For opening ports in your software firewall use the Windows Firewall with Advanced Security tool for Windows systems. For Linux based systems you can use the ufw or iptables tools.
